#Sudoku
This is my first own programming project for me as a freshman in computer science.
My objective is to write a programm, that fills an incomplete sudoku on it's own. At the same time I'm fooling around with git. So please ignore the mess in this repo.
I'm looking forward to any advice that will improve my code.
